<h1>GUTENBERG'S PRESS</h1>

<body><p>Johannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436, when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehan—a man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill. It was not until a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that official records exist, in which the testimony of witnesses discussed type, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type mold.</p>
</p>
<p>Others in Europe were developing movable type at this time, including goldsmith Procopius Waldfoghel of France and Laurens Janszoon Coster of the Netherlands. They are not known to have contributed specific advances to the printing press.</p>
<p>Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types invented in East Asia. To create these lead alloy types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention, a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template.</p>
<p>Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink that was more durable than the earlier water-based inks. For printing material, he used both vellum and paper, the latter having been introduced in Europe a few centuries earlier from China by way of the Arabs.</p>
<p>In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg performed a trial of colored printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.[5] A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials. It should be noted that the alphabet made an important contribution to the success of the printing press.</p>
