<h1>IMPACT ON SOCIETY</h1>

<p>Although the invention of movable type in China and Korea preceded Gutenberg's printing press, the impact of East Asian movable type printing presses was not as dramatically influential as it was in Western European society. This was likely due to the enormous amount of labor involved in manipulating the thousands of porcelain tablets, or in the case of Korea, metal tablets, required for Chinese characters. Nevertheless, hundreds of thousands of books, on subjects ranging from Confucian Classics to science and mathematics, were printed using the older technology of woodblock printing, creating the world's first print culture.
</p>
<p>By contrast, the impact of Gutenberg's printing press in Europe was comparable to the development of writing, or the invention of the alphabet or the Internet, regarding its impact on society.[1] Just as writing did not replace speaking, printing did not achieve a position of total dominance, and handwritten manuscripts continued to be produced. However, the cost of books was drastically reduced, and many copies of each book became quickly available. The wider availability of printed materials led to a drastic rise in adult literacy rate throughout Europe.</p>
<p>The printing press became valuable for scientists and scholars, as it enabled them to publish their discoveries and ideas and communicate with one another through scholarly journals. This development contributed to the coming of the scientific revolution. Moreover, even as the printing press allowed for rapid production and distribution of information, it led to an awareness of the importance of authorship and the need to cite references accurately. Before the advent of the printing press, the author's name was often lost.
</p>
<p>Within about 50 or 60 years from the invention of the printing press, practically the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated across Europe.[1] Now that more people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Furthermore, with the rise of book production as a commercial enterprise, the first copyright laws were passed to protect what we now call intellectual property rights.</p>
</p>
<p>An additional consequence of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works. Latin was replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. Paradoxically, the printing word also helped unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, thereby "decreasing" their variability. The rise in importance of national languages (as opposed to pan-European Latin) has been cited as one factor that led to the rise of nationalism in Europe.</p>
