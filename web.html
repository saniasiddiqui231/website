    <p>A printing press is a mechanical device to print many copies of text on a medium such as paper or cloth. The machine applies pressure to an inked surface resting on the medium, thereby transferring an image. Invention of the printing press has been attributed to various people, including Laurens J. Coster of the Netherlands and Panfilo Castaldi of Italy, but most scholars credit Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, with its invention.
    <p>Both woodblock printing and movable type printing technologies had been developed in ancient China and Korea a few hundred years earlier, but their presses differed from that used by Gutenberg and their impact was limited. Printing methods based on Gutenberg's printing press spread rapidly first across Europe and then the rest of the world. Books became widely available and affordable, leading to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe. In addition, scientists and scholars were able to publish their discoveries and ideas and communicate with one another through scholarly journals. This development contributed to the coming of the scientific revolution.
    </p>
    <p>Gutenberg's press was later replaced by a steam-powered machine, followed by the rotary printing press that allowed the printing of millions of copies of a page per day. As a means of creating reproductions for mass consumption, the printing press has recently been superseded by the advent of offset printing.</p>
    </p>
    <h2><b>Historical beginnings</b></h2>
    <p>The earliest form of printing, known as woodblock printing, appears to have originated in East Asia. In this technique, carved wooden blocks were pressed against sheets of paper to produce impressions on the paper. This method was used in China to print the Buddhist scripture known as the Diamond Sutra in the mid-ninth century CE.[2] Recently, another Buddhist scripture, dating to about 750 C.E., was discovered in a Korean pagoda and is regarded as the earliest known printed work in the world.</p>
    <p>The invention of printing with movable type has been attributed to Bi Sheng of China, who used clay type in 1041. Later, Wang Zhen produced wood type, which was more durable, and metal type was produced by members of the Korean Goryeo dynasty. The Jikji, printed in Korea in 1377, is the oldest extant book printed with movable metal type.</p>
    <p>The overall invention of Gutenberg's printing method depended for some of its elements on a combination of technologies from East Asia, including paper, woodblock printing, and possibly Bi Sheng's movable type printing technology. In addition, there was a growing demand by the general European public for the lower-cost paper books, instead of the exorbitantly expensive parchment books. By 1424, Cambridge University library owned only 122 books, each of which had a value equal to that of a farm or vineyard.[2] The demand for these books was driven by rising literacy among the middle class and students in Western Europe. At this time, the Renaissance was still in its early stages, and the populace was gradually removing the monopoly the clergy had held on literacy.The overall invention of Gutenberg's printing method depended for some of its elements on a combination of technologies from East Asia, including paper, woodblock printing, and possibly Bi Sheng's movable type printing technology.

    <p>Although woodblock printing had arrived in Europe at approximately the same time paper did, this method was not as suitable for literary communication as it was in the East.[2] Block printing is well-suited to written Chinese because character alignment is not critical. On the other hand, the existence of over 5,000 basic characters made the Chinese movable type technology somewhat inefficient and economically impractical, in terms of profits for the ancient Chinese book publishers. Movable type offered a great advance for the West, because the Latin alphabet requires precise alignment of a much simpler character set. In the development of the printing press, a key technological feature provided European inventors with advantage over their Chinese counterparts: the screw-based presses used in wine and olive oil production.[2] Attaining mechanical sophistication in approximately the year 1000 C.E., devices for applying pressure on a flat-plane were common in Europe.</p>
